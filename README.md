# Portfolio-Website
 This is my portfolio website repo. This is where I will be updating the website from

 To build this website I utilized HTML, CSS & JS for the frontend and Flask for the backend

 In terms of the frontend, I used base HTML templates for the page outlay and then Jinja to extend/fill in blocks of code for the different pages

 For the backend I used flask to handle the routing of the pages and I implimented certain content based on the route
 The main reason for using flask is to have the capacity to integrate github api for code display and run certain application such as plotly dash for project requirements
